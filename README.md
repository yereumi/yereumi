## 👋 Hi! I’m Yeji

🌱 I’m a backend engineer who loves learning and growing every day.

🚀 I learn fast and adapt quickly to new challenges.  
When a deployment issue occurred during a project, I dove into AWS documentation and references to identify the root cause and fix the problem within **five hours** — even without the support of our infrastructure engineer.

💡 I also value building services that truly put users first.  
By conducting performance tests with around **100 beta users**, analyzing feedback and logs, and optimizing our caching structure and query logic, I **improved response speed by over 90%**, delivering a faster and more stable user experience.

✨ Ultimately, my goal is to create technology that genuinely helps people — products that make someone’s day a little easier, better, and more meaningful.
